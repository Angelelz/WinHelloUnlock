# [WinHelloUnlock v1.5](https://github.com/Angelelz/WinHelloUnlock/releases/tag/v1.5)

- Fix [#35](https://github.com/Angelelz/WinHelloUnlock/issues/35). Check WinHello availability before asking to set the plugin up.
- Fix [#37](https://github.com/Angelelz/WinHelloUnlock/issues/37). If "remember master password (in encrypted form)..." is unchecked, the plugin does not work. Handled as advised [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/62b0b650/)
- If you are having problems like in [42](https://github.com/Angelelz/WinHelloUnlock/issues/42) and possibly [43](https://github.com/Angelelz/WinHelloUnlock/issues/43) after updating Keepass, try deleting the database's WinHelloUnlock data in the plugin options, and then create it again.
